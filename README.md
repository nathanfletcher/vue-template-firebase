# vue-simple-boilerplate (Firebase)

> The simplest possible Vue setup in a single HTML file

> This template is Vue 2.0 compatible. For Vue 1.x use this command: `vue init simple#1.0 my-project`

> This fork has been adapted to use firebase

### Before You Start...

This boilerplate is targeted at beginners who want to start exploring Vue without the distraction of a complicated development environment.

For advanced features such as asset compilation, hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing, and CSS extraction, we recommend that more experienced developers use one of the [other templates](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/).

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli                          # Install vue-cli if you haven't already
$ vue init nathanfletcher/vue-template-firebase   # Create a new project based on this template
$ cd my-project                                   # Navigate into your new project folder

//At this point, go to the readme withing the template to continue with the tutorial
```

### Fork It And Make Your Own

You can [fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to create your own boilerplate, and use it with `vue-cli`:

``` bash
vue init username/repo my-project
```
